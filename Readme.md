#Hackathon

##Close Ups

The following objectives were met through the hackathon.
 * Created a Back End model without a user/authorization using Adonis and deployed it onto Heroku.
 * Created three Front End routes
   1. Home Page - shows a list of all images
   2. Detail Page - a detailed view of a specific image and any comments
   3. Add Page - where a user can upload another image
 * An heart button to was placed on the image in the detail page and are able to track how many loves happen on a specific image. This can happen by "double-clicking" on the image. The count can be seen on both the home view as an overlay on the image and on the detail view.
