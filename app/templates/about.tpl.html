<div class="aboutMe">
  <p class="aboutUs">Close Up is an application that allows a user to upload close up images. <br><br>On the Front End, there are three routes: Home, Add and Detail. The Home page shows a list of all images, the detail page provides detailed view of a specific image that allows the user to add loves and comments, and the add page is where a user can upload an image. On the detail page, a heart button has been placed on the image. The count increases as the user double-clicks on the image. The count is tracked by the Back End and is placed on the Home page view as well as the Detail Page. <br><br> The Back End model was created without a user/authorization using Adonis and deployed to Heroku.
